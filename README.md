# ComMFD
OrbiterSound SDK Example "ComMFD"

This is just a simple "communications" MFD to basically try out some OrbiterSound 4.0 code.
Its main purpose is (was) to simulate radio communication between two vessels for docking purposes, like:

DG-01: "DG-01, ISS, request docking"

ISS: "Frequency 123.456 MHz"

...

The "voices" can be supplied by any user who likes to have another "voice". A nice exmaple is the  "CW" voice, that just transmitts in morse code ;)
